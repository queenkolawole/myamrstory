        Something is wrong with Sam, but I can't lay my fingers on it. Yet. I watch my six-month-old baby brother sleep
        in his cot. He has been sleeping for hours. This is quite unusual. Even when he fell ill some days ago, he still
        crawled around the house, up until yesterday. Maybe the medicine Mama used for him caused him to be drowsy, so I
        move closer to do a general checkup, first,
        to feel his temperature. I place the back of my palm on his cheeks and immediately draw back in alarm. 'Mama!' I
        shriek. 'Sam is dying!' I don't know the reason, but the words tumble from my lips. My baby brother's
        temperature is so high, and I can feel his heartbeat racing. I begin to cry. 'Mama!'
    </p>

    <h2 class="star">***</h2>
    <p>
        I watch the light in Mama's eye dim when the man in a white overall says Sam is not responding to treatment.
        'Why?' I demand, but never get an answer because the words don't leave my head. Sam is the kind of child you
        call a 'seed'. After 12 years of birthing me, Mama never had an issue, with the
        gossip and perceptible mockery of the women in our community. When they called her barren, I wondered if I was a
        log of wood. I don't know if she would ever live again if anything ever happened to her only son. 'Never!' I
        chastise myself at the forbidden thought.

    </p>

    <h2 class="star">***</h2>
    <p>Sam has sepsis, I finally discover. Mama says this more to herself than to me. I am not allowed to see my baby
        brother because he is in ICU. 'He may not survive it.' Mama says without looking at me, all color drained from
        her face as she stares straight
        ahead. These are not her words, I am sure of it. That man in white overall must have made her believe it. My
        stomach drops cold and heaviness descends upon me. Mama is scaring me. I begin to sweat. 'They say he is
        resistant to all the medicines they have been giving him,' she says in a frenzy. 'Nothing is working to treat
        the infection. Nothing.'</p>

    <p class="fire">'Resistant?' I wonder. 'What does this mean?' Again, the question never leaves my head. Instead, I watch Mama
        lose her
        mind.</p>

    <p>Antimicrobial resistance occurs
        when the antimicrobial agent meant to douse the harmful effects of microorganisms fails to destroy them because
        these microbes have become resistant to drugs.

        A major precipitating factor for this is the overuse and misuse of antimicrobials, hence making microorganisms
        evolve and develop strains that are resistant to the effects of antimicrobials, which results in infections that
        are harder and more expensive to treat. This leads to poor health outcomes and even death.

        Now, these resistant genes are transferable which is deadly, and if care is not taken, one day, microorganisms
        will rule the world, driving humans to extinction. </p>

       <p>What quota will you play in reducing AMR in your community?</p>

        <p>Never use antibiotics without a prescription. Never overuse, underuse, or misuse any antimicrobial agent. Always
        consult health professionals when you are ill, and don't self-medicate. </p>

        <p class="fire">'Resistant?' This is what antimicrobial resistanceÂ means.</p>
